# Sales Dashboard with Plotly Dash

## Overview

This project involves building an interactive sales dashboard using Plotly Dash in Python. The dashboard visualizes sales data by product, year, and region. It also features an integrated chatbot that leverages the Claude API to retrieve data from BigQuery and respond to user queries in natural language.

### Key Features:
- **Sales Visualization:** Displays sales trends by product, year, and region.
- **Interactive Chatbot:** Ask questions about the sales data, and the chatbot will fetch and provide insights using natural language processing.
- **Data Source:** Iowa Liquor Retail Sales dataset.

### Live Demo
The dashboard is hosted on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Virtual Machine. You can view it live here:
